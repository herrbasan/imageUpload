# Image Upload & Crop Tool

A client-side image processing tool that eliminates the complexity of image preparation for users. Instead of requiring users to manually resize, reformat, or crop images before upload, this strategy handles all image optimization in the browser, providing an accessible and intuitive editing experience.

This tool eliminates the common frustration of "image too large" or "wrong format" errors by handling all technical requirements transparently, while ensuring every user can successfully complete the image upload process regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies.

## Problem Statement

Traditional image upload workflows create barriers for users:
- **Technical Complexity**: Users must understand file size limits, format requirements, and aspect ratios
- **External Tools**: Requires separate image editing software or online tools
- **Accessibility Gaps**: Most image editing tools lack proper keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Multi-Step Process**: Forces users to leave the application to prepare images

## Solution

This tool moves image processing to the client side, allowing users to upload any supported image and interactively crop it to the required specifications directly in the browser. The complexity is hidden behind an intuitive interface that works for everyone.

## Accessibility First Design

### Universal Input Support
- **Mouse Control**: Standard click and drag interaction
- **Touch Gestures**: Native pinch-to-zoom and drag on mobile devices
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete functionality via arrow keys and tab navigation
- **Screen Reader Compatibility**: Comprehensive ARIA labels and live announcements

### Inclusive Interface
- **High Contrast Themes**: Built-in light/dark mode with system preference detection
- **Clear Focus Indicators**: Visible keyboard focus states throughout the interface
- **Semantic Structure**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark regions
- **Alternative Text**: Meaningful descriptions for all interactive elements

### Cognitive Accessibility
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time preview shows exactly what the final result will be
- **Simple Controls**: Intuitive zoom slider and fill/fit buttons reduce decision complexity
- **Forgiving Interface**: Unlimited undo through repositioning and rescaling

## Key Benefits

### For Users
- **No Pre-Processing Required**: Upload images in any supported format without worrying about size or dimensions
- **Single-Step Workflow**: Crop, resize, and optimize images without leaving the application
- **Format Flexibility**: Accepts JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG, TIFF, and AVIF files
- **Accessible to Everyone**: Works with assistive technologies and alternative input methods
- **Device Agnostic**: Same experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### For Developers
- **Reduced Server Load**: Client-side processing eliminates server-side image manipulation
- **Better User Experience**: Immediate feedback and preview reduces upload failures
- **Standard Compliance**: WCAG accessibility guidelines and modern web standards
- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript with no external frameworks

## Technical Features

### üñºÔ∏è Interactive Image Processing
- **Real-time Cropping**: Live preview with immediate visual feedback
- **Precision Controls**: Zoom from 0.2x to 5x with fine-grained positioning
- **Aspect Ratio Handling**: Fill (cover) and Fit (contain) modes for different use cases
- **Multi-Input Support**: Mouse, touch, and keyboard interaction patterns

### ‚ö° Performance Optimized
- **Web Workers**: Offscreen canvas processing prevents UI blocking
- **ImageBitmap API**: Efficient image transfer and manipulation
- **RequestAnimationFrame**: Smooth animations and responsive interactions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful fallback when advanced features aren't available

## Technical Architecture

### Modern ES6 Module Structure
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with proper imports/exports
- **No Dependencies**: Pure vanilla JavaScript, no external frameworks
- **Web Standards**: Uses modern browser APIs and best practices
- **Optional Web Worker**: Separate imageWorker.js for offscreen canvas processing when supported

## Possible Future Enhancements
- **Enhanced Image Format Support**: With WASM-based libraries, even obscure image formats could be supported.
- **Image Editing Features**: Simple image editing features could be added to allow for changing contrast, brightness, saturation, etc.
